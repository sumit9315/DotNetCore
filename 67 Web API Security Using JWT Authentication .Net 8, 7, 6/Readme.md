## 📘 **Part 67 – JWT Authentication in .NET Web API (Summary Notes)**

🧑‍🏫 *By NehanthWorld*

---

### 🔹 **1. Introduction & Previous Context**

* This video is part of a Web API Security series.
* Previously, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was covered.
* From this video onward, the focus is on **JWT (JSON Web Token) based Authentication** in .NET 6/7/8 Web API.

---

### 🔐 **2. Understanding Authentication vs Authorization**

#### ✅ **Authentication**

> *“Prove who you are”*

* The process of **verifying the identity** of a user or system.
* Required before consuming a secure API.
* 🔎 **Real-world analogy**: Showing your **ID card** at the entrance of an office or college campus.
* Once verified → you're allowed in.
* Example: Login using username and password.

#### ✅ **Authorization**

> *“Decide what you're allowed to do”*

* Happens **after authentication**.
* Defines **what resources/actions** the user can access.
* 🔎 **Analogy**: After entering campus, you're only allowed in your **assigned classroom/cabin** — not others.
* Implemented using **roles**.

---

### 🏗️ **3. Web API Application Example**

* The application contains multiple modules:

  * `StudentModule`
  * `FeesModule`
  * `AttendanceModule`
  * `ExaminationModule`
* 🔑 Example:

  * User A can only access `Fees` & `Examination`.
  * User B may only access `Student` module.
* 🔐 Authentication = Prove identity
* 🔓 Authorization = Limit actions based on **roles**

---

### 🪪 **4. JWT (JSON Web Token) Overview**

* ✅ Full form: **JSON Web Token**
* JWT is a **popular, stateless way** to secure APIs by encoding identity data into a token.
* It allows easy validation of identity **without saving session on the server**.

---

### 🔁 **5. How JWT Works**

1. **User logs in** with username/password.
2. Server **generates JWT** (containing identity/roles).
3. Server **sends token to client**.
4. Client sends token with each request (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
5. Server **validates the token** on every request.

   * If valid → access granted.
   * If invalid/missing → HTTP `401 Unauthorized`.

---

### 🧰 **6. JWT Implementation in .NET Core**

* Microsoft library used:

  ```
  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
  ```
* This NuGet package:

  * Helps generate the token.
  * Validates JWT tokens sent by the client.

---

### 🗒️ **7. Recap**

* Authentication = Login using credentials (e.g., username/password).
* Authorization = Access control using roles.
* JWT helps in securing APIs by using encoded tokens instead of traditional session management.

---

### 📺 **Next Video**

* A deeper look into:

  * What is inside a JWT?
  * How to configure JWT in .NET Web API?

---

### 📌 Final Thoughts

* JWT = Secure, scalable way to manage access.
* Ideal for **stateless APIs** and microservices.
* Avoids the need to store sessions on the server.

## 📘 Notes: Understanding JWT in Web API (Part 2)

---

### 🔹 What is JWT?

* **JWT** stands for **JSON Web Token**.
* It is a **popular mechanism** for securing Web APIs.
* Information is **Base64-encoded** and transferred between client and server in a token format.
* JWTs are:

  * Lightweight
  * URL-safe
  * Easy to validate on the server
* Based on **open standard**: `RFC 7519`.

---

### 🔹 Purpose of JWT

* Used to **represent claims securely between two parties** (usually server ↔ client).
* Used in **stateless authentication** (i.e., no session stored on server).
* Encodes identity and role of a user or system.

---

### 🔹 JWT Structure

A JWT has **three parts**, all Base64-encoded and separated by dots:

```
<HEADER>.<PAYLOAD>.<SIGNATURE>
```

---

### 1️⃣ Header

* Contains metadata about the token.
* Example:

  ```json
  {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }
  ```
* `alg` → algorithm used (e.g., HS256, RS256, or "none").
* `typ` → token type (usually `"JWT"`).
* 🔴 **If `alg` is `none`**, the token is **not secure**.

---

### 2️⃣ Payload

* The **actual data** or claims being sent.
* Common fields:

  * `id`: User ID
  * `name`: Username
  * `role`: User's role (admin, user, etc.)
* Represents **who is authenticated**.
* This info is sent to the **client** upon login.
* When client sends the token back, server **extracts** these values for authorization.

---

### 3️⃣ Signature

* Ensures the token was **not tampered with**.
* Generated using:

  ```
  signature = Base64Encode(
    HMACSHA256(
      Base64(header) + "." + Base64(payload),
      secret_key
    )
  )
  ```
* **Private key** (stored securely on the server) is used to generate it.
* Without a valid signature, the token should be **rejected**.

---

### 🔒 Security Notes

* A JWT **without a signature** is **not secure**.
* Always ensure that your token includes and validates the signature on every API request.

### ✅ Summary

| Part      | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Header    | Metadata: algorithm & type                             |
| Payload   | User data / claims (id, name, role)                    |
| Signature | Verifies the token's integrity (generated with secret) |

* JWT tokens are ideal for **stateless, secure communication** between frontend & backend.

---

### 📌 Real Use Case Flow

1. User logs in → Server verifies credentials.
2. Server **creates JWT** and returns to client.
3. Client stores token (e.g., in localStorage).
4. For each request, client sends:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
   ```
5. Server validates token → Grants/denies access.
