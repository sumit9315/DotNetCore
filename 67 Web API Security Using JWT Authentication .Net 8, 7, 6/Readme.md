## 📘 **Part 67 – JWT Authentication in .NET Web API (Summary Notes)**

🧑‍🏫 *By NehanthWorld*

---

### 🔹 **1. Introduction & Previous Context**

* This video is part of a Web API Security series.
* Previously, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was covered.
* From this video onward, the focus is on **JWT (JSON Web Token) based Authentication** in .NET 6/7/8 Web API.

---

### 🔐 **2. Understanding Authentication vs Authorization**

#### ✅ **Authentication**

> *“Prove who you are”*

* The process of **verifying the identity** of a user or system.
* Required before consuming a secure API.
* 🔎 **Real-world analogy**: Showing your **ID card** at the entrance of an office or college campus.
* Once verified → you're allowed in.
* Example: Login using username and password.

#### ✅ **Authorization**

> *“Decide what you're allowed to do”*

* Happens **after authentication**.
* Defines **what resources/actions** the user can access.
* 🔎 **Analogy**: After entering campus, you're only allowed in your **assigned classroom/cabin** — not others.
* Implemented using **roles**.

---

### 🏗️ **3. Web API Application Example**

* The application contains multiple modules:

  * `StudentModule`
  * `FeesModule`
  * `AttendanceModule`
  * `ExaminationModule`
* 🔑 Example:

  * User A can only access `Fees` & `Examination`.
  * User B may only access `Student` module.
* 🔐 Authentication = Prove identity
* 🔓 Authorization = Limit actions based on **roles**

---

### 🪪 **4. JWT (JSON Web Token) Overview**

* ✅ Full form: **JSON Web Token**
* JWT is a **popular, stateless way** to secure APIs by encoding identity data into a token.
* It allows easy validation of identity **without saving session on the server**.

---

### 🔁 **5. How JWT Works**

1. **User logs in** with username/password.
2. Server **generates JWT** (containing identity/roles).
3. Server **sends token to client**.
4. Client sends token with each request (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
5. Server **validates the token** on every request.

   * If valid → access granted.
   * If invalid/missing → HTTP `401 Unauthorized`.

---

### 🧰 **6. JWT Implementation in .NET Core**

* Microsoft library used:

  ```
  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
  ```
* This NuGet package:

  * Helps generate the token.
  * Validates JWT tokens sent by the client.

---

### 🗒️ **7. Recap**

* Authentication = Login using credentials (e.g., username/password).
* Authorization = Access control using roles.
* JWT helps in securing APIs by using encoded tokens instead of traditional session management.

  * What is inside a JWT?
  * How to configure JWT in .NET Web API?

---

### 📌 Final Thoughts

* JWT = Secure, scalable way to manage access.
* Ideal for **stateless APIs** and microservices.
* Avoids the need to store sessions on the server.
