## 📘 **Part 67 – JWT Authentication in .NET Web API (Summary Notes)**

🧑‍🏫 *By NehanthWorld*

---

### 🔹 **1. Introduction & Previous Context**

* This video is part of a Web API Security series.
* Previously, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was covered.
* From this video onward, the focus is on **JWT (JSON Web Token) based Authentication** in .NET 6/7/8 Web API.

---

### 🔐 **2. Understanding Authentication vs Authorization**

#### ✅ **Authentication**

> *“Prove who you are”*

* The process of **verifying the identity** of a user or system.
* Required before consuming a secure API.
* 🔎 **Real-world analogy**: Showing your **ID card** at the entrance of an office or college campus.
* Once verified → you're allowed in.
* Example: Login using username and password.

#### ✅ **Authorization**

> *“Decide what you're allowed to do”*

* Happens **after authentication**.
* Defines **what resources/actions** the user can access.
* 🔎 **Analogy**: After entering campus, you're only allowed in your **assigned classroom/cabin** — not others.
* Implemented using **roles**.

---

### 🏗️ **3. Web API Application Example**

* The application contains multiple modules:

  * `StudentModule`
  * `FeesModule`
  * `AttendanceModule`
  * `ExaminationModule`
* 🔑 Example:

  * User A can only access `Fees` & `Examination`.
  * User B may only access `Student` module.
* 🔐 Authentication = Prove identity
* 🔓 Authorization = Limit actions based on **roles**

---

### 🪪 **4. JWT (JSON Web Token) Overview**

* ✅ Full form: **JSON Web Token**
* JWT is a **popular, stateless way** to secure APIs by encoding identity data into a token.
* It allows easy validation of identity **without saving session on the server**.

---

### 🔁 **5. How JWT Works**

1. **User logs in** with username/password.
2. Server **generates JWT** (containing identity/roles).
3. Server **sends token to client**.
4. Client sends token with each request (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
5. Server **validates the token** on every request.

   * If valid → access granted.
   * If invalid/missing → HTTP `401 Unauthorized`.

---

### 🧰 **6. JWT Implementation in .NET Core**

* Microsoft library used:

  ```
  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
  ```
* This NuGet package:

  * Helps generate the token.
  * Validates JWT tokens sent by the client.

---

### 🗒️ **7. Recap**

* Authentication = Login using credentials (e.g., username/password).
* Authorization = Access control using roles.
* JWT helps in securing APIs by using encoded tokens instead of traditional session management.

---

### 📺 **Next Video**

* A deeper look into:

  * What is inside a JWT?
  * How to configure JWT in .NET Web API?

---

### 📌 Final Thoughts

* JWT = Secure, scalable way to manage access.
* Ideal for **stateless APIs** and microservices.
* Avoids the need to store sessions on the server.

* 🔧 A working JWT implementation in .NET Core (step-by-step)?
* 🧪 Unit test examples for authentication logic?
* 🧠 Visual diagram of the JWT flow?

## 📘 Notes: Understanding JWT in Web API (Part 2)

---

### 🔹 What is JWT?

* **JWT** stands for **JSON Web Token**.
* It is a **popular mechanism** for securing Web APIs.
* Information is **Base64-encoded** and transferred between client and server in a token format.
* JWTs are:

  * Lightweight
  * URL-safe
  * Easy to validate on the server
* Based on **open standard**: `RFC 7519`.

---

### 🔹 Purpose of JWT

* Used to **represent claims securely between two parties** (usually server ↔ client).
* Used in **stateless authentication** (i.e., no session stored on server).
* Encodes identity and role of a user or system.

---

### 🔹 JWT Structure

A JWT has **three parts**, all Base64-encoded and separated by dots:

```
<HEADER>.<PAYLOAD>.<SIGNATURE>
```

---

### 1️⃣ Header

* Contains metadata about the token.
* Example:

  ```json
  {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }
  ```
* `alg` → algorithm used (e.g., HS256, RS256, or "none").
* `typ` → token type (usually `"JWT"`).
* 🔴 **If `alg` is `none`**, the token is **not secure**.

---

### 2️⃣ Payload

* The **actual data** or claims being sent.
* Common fields:

  * `id`: User ID
  * `name`: Username
  * `role`: User's role (admin, user, etc.)
* Represents **who is authenticated**.
* This info is sent to the **client** upon login.
* When client sends the token back, server **extracts** these values for authorization.

---

### 3️⃣ Signature

* Ensures the token was **not tampered with**.
* Generated using:

  ```
  signature = Base64Encode(
    HMACSHA256(
      Base64(header) + "." + Base64(payload),
      secret_key
    )
  )
  ```
* **Private key** (stored securely on the server) is used to generate it.
* Without a valid signature, the token should be **rejected**.

---

### 🔒 Security Notes

* A JWT **without a signature** is **not secure**.
* Always ensure that your token includes and validates the signature on every API request.

### ✅ Summary

| Part      | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Header    | Metadata: algorithm & type                             |
| Payload   | User data / claims (id, name, role)                    |
| Signature | Verifies the token's integrity (generated with secret) |

* JWT tokens are ideal for **stateless, secure communication** between frontend & backend.

---

### 📌 Real Use Case Flow

1. User logs in → Server verifies credentials.
2. Server **creates JWT** and returns to client.
3. Client stores token (e.g., in localStorage).
4. For each request, client sends:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
   ```
5. Server validates token → Grants/denies access.

Great question! Let's break it down clearly:

---

## 🎯 **Where do `audience` and `issuer` go in a JWT?**

Both `aud` (audience) and `iss` (issuer) are part of the **payload** of a JWT — **not** the header.

---

### ✅ JWT Structure Recap:

```
Header       → Metadata (algorithm, type)
Payload      → Claims (data like user ID, role, iss, aud, etc.)
Signature    → Ensures token integrity
```

---

### 🧾 So:

| Claim | Full Name | Location    | Purpose                                            |
| ----- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `iss` | Issuer    | **Payload** | Who issued the token (e.g., your API, auth server) |
| `aud` | Audience  | **Payload** | Who the token is meant for (e.g., client app)      |

---

### 🔐 Why in the Payload?

* The **payload** carries all claims — user info, roles, expiration, and validation-related fields like `aud` and `iss`.
* These fields are **signed and verifiable**, even though they’re not encrypted by default.

---

### 📦 Example JWT Payload:

```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "name": "Sumit",
  "role": "Admin",
  "iss": "https://auth.mysite.com",
  "aud": "https://myapp.mysite.com",
  "exp": 1715677830
}
```

---

## 📌 Summary

| Claim        | In Header? | In Payload? | Notes                               |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `alg`, `typ` | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No        | These are **only** in the header    |
| `iss`, `aud` | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes       | These are **always** in the payload |

---

### 🧠 In .NET (ASP.NET Core)

When configuring JWT validation, you check `iss` and `aud` like this:

```csharp
options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
{
    ValidateIssuer = true,
    ValidateAudience = true,
    ValidIssuer = "https://auth.mysite.com",
    ValidAudience = "https://myapp.mysite.com",
    // ... other validation params
};
```

---

Let me know if you'd like a live .NET JWT example showing `iss` and `aud` validation in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.
Great — let’s slow down and **break it into the simplest terms** using a real-world analogy 🔍

---

## 🧾 JWT Claim: What is **Audience (`aud`)**?

### 📌 Definition:

> **`aud` (audience)** is the intended **receiver of the token** — the system that will **accept and validate** the token.

---

### 👨‍🏫 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine:

* You go to the **passport office** (issuer).
* You get a **passport** (token).
* The passport says: “Valid for entry into **USA only**.”

Here:

* **You** are the user.
* **Passport Office** = Issuer (`iss`)
* **USA** = Audience (`aud`)
* **Passport** = JWT token

If you try to use that passport to enter **Japan**, they’ll reject it — it was **not issued for them**.

---

## 💻 In JWT for APIs:

Let’s say:

* You have a backend API: `https://api.myapp.com`
* You have a login service: `https://auth.myapp.com`
* A frontend app: `https://web.myapp.com`

### 🏷️ Token might contain:

```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "iss": "https://auth.myapp.com",     // Who created the token
  "aud": "https://api.myapp.com"       // Who it's intended for
}
```

So:

| Claim | Meaning                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `iss` | The token was issued by your **auth server**. |
| `aud` | The token is **meant for your backend API**.  |

---

### 🤔 Why do we need `aud`?

To **prevent misuse**.

If someone tries to use the token meant for `https://api.myapp.com` with a different API like `https://bank-api.com`, it should be **rejected**.

---

## ✅ In Simple Words:

| Term  | Represents                           | Think of it as...                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `iss` | Who issued the token                 | 🏛️ The passport office                  |
| `aud` | Who should accept/validate the token | 🌎 The country the passport is valid for |

---

## ⚙️ In .NET Code:

When validating the token:

```csharp
options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
{
    ValidateIssuer = true,
    ValidateAudience = true,
    ValidIssuer = "https://auth.myapp.com",
    ValidAudience = "https://api.myapp.com"
};
```

---

### 🔐 Summary

| You want to protect... | You set audience to...                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| A backend API          | The API’s URL or name                          |
| A mobile app           | App package name or app URL                    |
| A frontend web app     | The client URL (if it validates tokens itself) |

---

Let me know:

* Would you like a **JWT flow diagram**?
* Or a real working .NET Core JWT project with `aud` and `iss`?

I can help with both.
Excellent and very practical question. You're asking how **JWT token generation and validation works when secrets are stored securely**, like in:

* 🔐 **HashiCorp Vault**
* 🟤 **AWS Secrets Manager**
* 🔵 **Azure Key Vault**
* 🔑 **Azure AD**

And how it fits into your login process, JWT issuance, and backend validation.

Let’s go **step by step** using a complete, real-world login flow involving frontend, auth service, secret vault, and backend API.

---

## 🎯 Scenario Recap

You said:

* You have a **UI login page** (e.g., React/Angular frontend).
* On login submit, the UI sends credentials to some **auth API** (not directly to backend).
* That API issues a **JWT token**.
* The **JWT is validated** by your backend API (on protected routes).
* Your secret is stored in **Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault** (not hardcoded).

You want to know:

* Who is the **issuer**?
* How is the **token generated**?
* How does the **secret in the vault** play a role?
* How is the **token validated later by backend**?

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Flow

Let’s break this into:

### **Phase 1: Login & Token Generation**

### **Phase 2: Token Validation on Backend API**

---

## 🟢 Phase 1: Login and JWT Generation

### 🔁 Flow:

1. 🔐 **Frontend (React/Angular)** sends a POST request to your **Auth Service**:

   ```
   POST /auth/login
   Body: { username: "sumit", password: "123456" }
   ```

2. 🧠 **Auth Service** verifies username & password (e.g., against database).

3. ✅ If login is successful, it now needs to **generate a JWT token**.

   **To generate the token**, it needs a:

   * `issuer` (`iss`) → usually your auth service domain like `"https://auth.myapp.com"`
   * `audience` (`aud`) → usually your backend API URL like `"https://api.myapp.com"`
   * `secret key` → 🔐 fetched securely from Vault/Secrets Manager

---

### 🔑 How Secret Vault Fits In:

* Auth service **does NOT store the secret in code**.
* Instead, it does something like this:

```csharp
// Inside your AuthController or TokenService
string jwtSecret = vaultService.GetSecret("jwt-signing-key");

// then use this secret to sign JWT:
var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jwtSecret));
var creds = new SigningCredentials(key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
    issuer: "https://auth.myapp.com",
    audience: "https://api.myapp.com",
    claims: claimsList,
    expires: DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
    signingCredentials: creds
);
```

### 📤 Result:

* Auth Service sends JWT token to the frontend in the response.
* Frontend stores it (localStorage / sessionStorage).
* On every API request, frontend sends:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

---

## 🔵 Phase 2: Backend API Validates JWT

### 🛂 What Happens on API Call

1. Backend receives request with JWT token in the `Authorization` header.
2. It must **validate** the token:

   * Check signature ✅
   * Check expiration ✅
   * Check `iss` (issuer) ✅
   * Check `aud` (audience) ✅

### 🔐 Where Secret Comes From?

* Backend **does NOT hardcode** the secret either.
* During startup (e.g., in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`), it reads the secret from Vault:

```csharp
string jwtSecret = vaultService.GetSecret("jwt-signing-key");

services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidIssuer = "https://auth.myapp.com",

            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidAudience = "https://api.myapp.com",

            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
            IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jwtSecret)),

            ValidateLifetime = true
        };
    });
```

* Now the backend can **validate the token** using the same secret key fetched from Vault.

---

## 🔁 Summary Flow

| Step | Action                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣  | Frontend sends login request to Auth API                     |
| 2️⃣  | Auth API validates user, fetches signing secret from Vault   |
| 3️⃣  | Auth API issues JWT (includes `iss`, `aud`, etc.)            |
| 4️⃣  | Frontend stores JWT and sends it in headers for future calls |
| 5️⃣  | Backend API fetches secret from Vault during startup         |
| 6️⃣  | Backend validates JWT signature + claims using same secret   |

---

## ❓Q: What if Auth and Backend Use Different Vaults?

No problem — **as long as both use the exact same secret value**, the JWT can be validated.

* Vault can be:

  * HashiCorp Vault
  * AWS Secrets Manager
  * Azure Key Vault
* Backend and Auth service can both read from their respective vaults **during app startup**.

---

## 🚫 Bonus: Azure AD Case

If you're using **Azure AD** instead of custom JWT:

* Tokens are signed using **asymmetric key pairs** (RSA).
* Azure provides **public keys via OpenID URL** (no secret needed).
* Your backend uses `Microsoft.Identity.Web` or `JwtBearerOptions` with:

```csharp
options.Authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/v2.0";
```

✅ No secret needed from vault — validation is done using **Azure AD public keys**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

| Case                      | Secret Location           | Token Signed Using         | Token Validated Using |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Custom Auth with JWT      | HashiCorp/AWS/Azure Vault | HMAC + Secret Key          | Same Secret Key       |
| Azure AD / OAuth Provider | Azure                     | RSA Private Key (Azure AD) | Public Key (via URL)  |
