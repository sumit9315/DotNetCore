# üìò Web API Tutorials ‚Äì Part 2: Evolution of Web API

**Presented by: Venkat**
**Topic:** Evolution of Web API
**Objective:** Understand how web APIs evolved from basic web services to WCF and finally to Web API, including motivations and architecture.

## üåê Introduction

Welcome back to Web API tutorials. I am **Venkat** and this is **Part 2 ‚Äì The Evolution of Web API**.

Before discussing the evolution of Web API, we need to understand the **evolution of web services**.

---

## üß† Understanding Traditional Web Applications

To start, let‚Äôs understand how basic web applications work.

* A **web application** typically involves:

  * A **web server**
  * **Clients** (end users) accessing it through **browsers** like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer.

### Basic Flow:

```
Browser (Client) ‚áÑ Web Server
```

The **client (browser)** sends a request to the web server, the **server processes** the request, and then **responds** back. This is a simple request-response architecture.

---

## üåç Communication Between Two Web Servers

Now imagine this:

* **Web Server 1** is running a **.NET application**
* **Web Server 2** is running a **Java application**

### Challenge:

.NET uses:

* C# classes
* DataSets, DataTables, and DataReaders for data representation

Java, however, has its **own object model** and **does not understand** C# classes or .NET-specific objects.

So, how do they communicate?

---

## üí° Solution: Web Services

To solve this interoperability issue, **web services** were introduced.

### Goal of Web Services:

> Establish communication between two different platforms by using a **common data representation format**.

### Problem Recap:

* .NET objects ‚â† Java objects
* Java objects ‚â† Python objects
* Each technology has its **own internal data structure**

### Solution:

Web services use **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)** ‚Äî a **platform-independent format**.

### Why XML?

Because:

* .NET understands XML
* Java understands XML
* Python, JavaScript, and other platforms also support XML

---

## üîó Example Communication via Web Services

### Scenario:

* .NET Application wants to communicate with Java Application

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. A **web service** is built on the .NET side, which provides a **WSDL file** (Web Services Description Language).
2. A **proxy class** is generated from the WSDL file.
3. The .NET objects (e.g., DataSet, DataReader) are **serialized to XML** using the proxy instructions.
4. XML is sent to the Java application.
5. The **Java side** also has a proxy, built using the same WSDL.
6. The proxy **deserializes** the XML into Java objects.

üí° **Result:** Both sides communicate using a neutral format ‚Äî **XML**, thanks to the proxy and WSDL.

### Protocol Used:

> **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

---

## ‚ûï Reverse Communication (Java ‚Üí .NET)

The process is the same in reverse:

* Java serializes its object to XML
* XML sent to .NET
* WSDL-generated proxy on .NET side deserializes XML into .NET objects

---

## üîÑ Introduction of WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)

After web services became common, Microsoft introduced **WCF** to overcome certain limitations of SOAP-based services.

### Why WCF?

While web services:

* Mostly support **HTTP**
* Are limited to **SOAP/XML**

WCF supports:

* **Multiple protocols** (HTTP, TCP, MSMQ)
* **Multiple data formats** (SOAP, REST, JSON, etc.)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Limitations of WCF

Although WCF is powerful, it came with complexity:

* Requires **multiple configurations**:

  * Which protocol?
  * Which serialization format?
  * Data contracts and bindings
* Even for simple **CRUD** operations over HTTP, **developers must configure everything manually**

üí° This made WCF **heavy and complex** for basic REST APIs.

---

## üåê Birth of ASP.NET Web API

To simplify REST API development, Microsoft introduced **Web API**.

### Features of Web API:

* Designed specifically for **HTTP protocol**
* Focused on **CRUD operations** via REST
* No configuration required to get started
* Automatically maps:

  * **POST ‚Üí Create**
  * **GET ‚Üí Read**
  * **PUT ‚Üí Update**
  * **DELETE ‚Üí Delete**

### Benefits:

* Lightweight
* Easy to use
* No verbose configuration like WCF
* Directly designed for web service development over HTTP

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

| Requirement                           | Use WCF         | Use Web API   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| SOAP-based services                   | ‚úÖ               | ‚ùå             |
| RESTful HTTP services                 | ‚úÖ (but complex) | ‚úÖ (preferred) |
| Multiple protocol support (TCP, MSMQ) | ‚úÖ               | ‚ùå             |
| Duplex communication                  | ‚úÖ               | ‚ùå             |
| Lightweight CRUD over HTTP            | ‚ùå (overkill)    | ‚úÖ             |
| JSON or XML only                      | ‚ùå               | ‚úÖ             |

## üß≠ Summary: Evolution Timeline

```text
Web Services (SOAP + XML)
       ‚Üì
WCF (Multiple Protocols + Complex Configuration)
       ‚Üì
ASP.NET Web API (Simple HTTP-based APIs)
```

Most modern services are built using **HTTP + REST**, which is why Web API has become the go-to choice.

---

## üôè Conclusion

This is the **evolution of Web API**, from:

* **Web Services (SOAP/XML)**
* To **WCF (multi-protocol but complex)**
* To **Web API (simple, HTTP-focused)**
