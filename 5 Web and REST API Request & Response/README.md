# 📘 Web API Tutorials – Part 5: Web API Request and Response

**Instructor:** Venkat
**Topic:** Understanding Request and Response Objects in Web API

---

## 🔍 Introduction

Welcome back to Web API Tutorials!
I am **Venkat**, and this is **Part 5: Web API Request and Response**.

In this session, we will understand:

* ✅ What is a **request**?
* ✅ What is a **response**?
* ✅ What are the **components** of request and response objects?

---

## 🌐 Client-Server Communication Model

In distributed applications like a **client-server model**:

* **Client** sends a **request** to the **server**
* **Server** processes the request and sends back a **response**

```text
Client → Request → Server → Process → Response → Client
```

## 📨 Web API Request Object – Components

The **Request Object** in Web API has **3 main components**:

| Component   | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Verb**    | HTTP method (action)                    |
| **Headers** | Metadata or instructions sent to server |
| **Content** | Actual data being sent                  |

---

### 1️⃣ Verb (HTTP Action)

HTTP Verbs define the **action** to be taken:

| Verb     | Action                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| `GET`    | Read data               |
| `POST`   | Create new data         |
| `PUT`    | Update entire record    |
| `DELETE` | Remove a record         |
| `PATCH`  | Update part of a record |

> These are the **primary HTTP methods** used in Web API.

---

### 2️⃣ Headers (Metadata)

Headers provide **additional information** to the server.

#### Sample Headers:

| Header           | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Content-Type`   | Indicates the format of request data (e.g., JSON, XML) |
| `Content-Length` | Size of the content in bytes                           |
| `Authorization`  | Used for sending security tokens like bearer tokens    |

---

### 3️⃣ Content (Payload)

The **content** is the actual data being sent to the server — e.g., JSON data for a POST request.

---

## 📤 Web API Response Object – Components

The **Response Object** also has **3 components**:

| Component   | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Status**  | HTTP status code (success, error, etc.) |
| **Headers** | Metadata in the response                |
| **Content** | Data being sent back to the client      |

---

### 1️⃣ Status Codes

Status codes indicate the **result** of the request.

#### HTTP Status Code Series:

| Range     | Type          |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `100–199` | Informational |
| `200–299` | Success       |
| `300–399` | Redirection   |
| `400–499` | Client errors |
| `500–599` | Server errors |

---

### ✅ 200-Series (Success Codes)

| Code  | Meaning                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `200` | OK – Standard success                     |
| `201` | Created – For POST operations             |
| `204` | No Content – Success but nothing returned |

---

### 🚫 400-Series (Client Errors)

| Code  | Meaning                                             |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `400` | Bad Request – Client sent invalid data              |
| `401` | Unauthorized – Missing/invalid token                |
| `404` | Not Found – Requested resource doesn't exist        |
| `409` | Conflict – Resource conflict, e.g., duplicate entry |

---

### 💥 500-Series (Server Errors)

| Code  | Meaning                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `500` | Internal Server Error – General server failure |

---

### 2️⃣ Headers in Response

Similar to request headers, response headers provide metadata:

| Header           | Purpose                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Content-Type`   | Format of response (JSON, XML, etc.) |
| `Content-Length` | Size of response body                |

> ⚠️ Note: `Authorization` is typically used in the **request**, not in the response.

---

### 3️⃣ Content in Response

This is the **actual data** returned by the server.
Examples: JSON result, list of items, user object, etc.

---

## 📚 Summary – Request vs. Response

| Feature | Request Object                | Response Object              |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Verb    | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH | N/A                          |
| Headers | Content-Type, Auth, etc.      | Content-Type, Content-Length |
| Content | Data sent to server           | Data received from server    |
| Status  | N/A                           | Status code (200, 404, etc.) |

---

## 🙏 Conclusion

You’ve now learned:

* How a **request** is constructed in Web API
* What goes into a **response**
* The meaning behind **status codes**
* Why headers and content are crucial for communication
