# 📘 VBPI Tutorials – Part 7: Returning Complex Objects from a Web API Endpoint

**Instructor:** Venkat
**Topic:** How to return a **complex object** (single class or a list of classes) from an API endpoint

---

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome back to **VBPI Tutorials**, I’m **Venkat**, and this is **Part 7**.

In the **previous video**, we saw how to return a **simple string** from an action method or endpoint.

In this video, we will learn:

* ✅ How to return a **complex object**
* ✅ How to return a **list of objects**
* ✅ How to structure the code using a **model class**
* ✅ A sneak peek into using a **repository**

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Clean Up Default Controllers

We had two controllers previously.
The default `ValuesController` is **no longer required**, so it can be **removed**.

We’ll continue with the existing `StudentController`.

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Modify Action Method to Return a List

Update your method inside `StudentController` to:

```csharp
public IEnumerable<Student> GetStudents()
```

---

## 📁 Step 3: Create the Student Model

1. Add a new folder called `Models`
2. Inside it, add a new class called `Student.cs`

### `Student.cs`:

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}
```

✅ This class will represent a **complex object** structure returned from the API.

---

## ✏️ Step 4: Return a List of Students

In `StudentController.cs`, import the `Models` namespace and update your method to return data like:

```csharp
using YourApp.Models; // Replace with your actual namespace

[HttpGet]
public IEnumerable<Student> GetStudents()
{
    return new List<Student>
    {
        new Student
        {
            StudentId = 1,
            StudentName = "Student 1",
            Email = "email1@gmail.com",
            Address = "Hyderabad, India"
        },
        new Student
        {
            StudentId = 2,
            StudentName = "Student 2",
            Email = "email2@gmail.com",
            Address = "Bangalore, India"
        }
    };
}
```

📌 The endpoint now returns a **list of complex Student objects**.

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Test in Swagger UI

1. Run the application
2. Open **Swagger UI**
3. Find the `GET /api/student` endpoint
4. Click `Try it out` → `Execute`

### ✅ Sample Output:

```json
[
  {
    "studentId": 1,
    "studentName": "Student 1",
    "email": "email1@gmail.com",
    "address": "Hyderabad, India"
  },
  {
    "studentId": 2,
    "studentName": "Student 2",
    "email": "email2@gmail.com",
    "address": "Bangalore, India"
  }
]
```

---

## 🧼 Step 6: Code Clean-Up (Next Step Preview)

Currently, we’re creating the **student list directly inside the controller**, which:

* ❌ Makes the controller bulky
* ❌ Is not scalable
* ❌ Violates clean code practices

### ✅ Recommended Next Step:

Move this logic into a **static repository class** to:

* Separate concerns
* Improve maintainability
* Follow a cleaner architecture

---

## ✅ Summary

In this part, you’ve learned how to:

* Return a **complex object** using Web API
* Use a **Model class** (`Student.cs`)
* Return a **list of objects** instead of a static string
* View structured JSON response in **Swagger**

---

## 🎬 What’s Next?

In the next video, we will:

* Create a **static repository**
* Move student list logic into the repository
* Call the repository from the controller

---

## 🙏 Conclusion
Here is the **updated version** of your **Part 7 documentation**, now enhanced with **detailed code explanations**, so even beginners can understand **why** each line is used and **how** it fits into the API logic.

# 📘 VBPI Tutorials – Part 7: Returning Complex Objects from a Web API Endpoint

**Instructor:** Venkat
**Topic:** How to return a **complex object** (single class or a list of classes) from a Web API endpoint using ASP.NET Core

---

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome back to **VBPI Tutorials**, I’m **Venkat**, and this is **Part 7**.

In the **previous video**, we saw how to return a **simple string** from a Web API endpoint.

In this video, we will:

* ✅ Return a **complex object**
* ✅ Return a **list of objects**
* ✅ Create a **Model class**
* ✅ Lay the foundation for using a **repository** in the next part

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Clean Up Default Controllers

If you still have the default controller `ValuesController`, you can **safely remove it**. It’s just a placeholder added by default.

We’ll continue with `StudentController`, which is more meaningful for our domain.

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Modify Action Method to Return a List

We now change our `GetStudents` method to return multiple student objects:

```csharp
public IEnumerable<Student> GetStudents()
```

### 🔍 Why?

* `IEnumerable<Student>` means we are returning a **list of Student objects**.
* This allows the API to respond with multiple student records as a JSON array.

---

## 📁 Step 3: Create the Student Model

### ✅ Step-by-step:

1. Add a new folder named `Models` to organize your data classes.
2. Inside it, create a new file called `Student.cs`.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }       // Unique ID for each student
    public string StudentName { get; set; }  // Full name of the student
    public string Email { get; set; }        // Email address
    public string Address { get; set; }      // City or full address
}
```

### 🔍 Why?

* This class is used as a **data model** (or DTO - Data Transfer Object).
* It defines the structure of what each student object will look like when returned via the API.

---

## ✏️ Step 4: Return a List of Students in Controller

Update the `StudentController` to return a list of student records:

```csharp
using YourApp.Models; // 👈 Import the namespace where Student.cs is defined

[HttpGet] // 👈 This maps HTTP GET requests to the method below
public IEnumerable<Student> GetStudents()
{
    return new List<Student>
    {
        new Student
        {
            StudentId = 1,
            StudentName = "Student 1",
            Email = "email1@gmail.com",
            Address = "Hyderabad, India"
        },
        new Student
        {
            StudentId = 2,
            StudentName = "Student 2",
            Email = "email2@gmail.com",
            Address = "Bangalore, India"
        }
    };
}
```

### 🔍 Explanation of Key Parts:

| Line/Part                  | What it does                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `using YourApp.Models;`    | Allows access to the `Student` class from the Models folder |
| `[HttpGet]`                | Marks this method as a response to an HTTP GET request      |
| `IEnumerable<Student>`     | Specifies the method will return multiple students          |
| `new List<Student>`        | Creates an in-memory list of hardcoded students for testing |
| Each `new Student { ... }` | Creates and populates one `Student` object with test data   |

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Test in Swagger UI

Once you run the app:

1. Swagger will open automatically (or go to `/swagger`).
2. Find the `GET /api/student` endpoint.
3. Click **Try it out** → **Execute**.

### ✅ Expected Output:

```json
[
  {
    "studentId": 1,
    "studentName": "Student 1",
    "email": "email1@gmail.com",
    "address": "Hyderabad, India"
  },
  {
    "studentId": 2,
    "studentName": "Student 2",
    "email": "email2@gmail.com",
    "address": "Bangalore, India"
  }
]
```

This confirms the endpoint is returning a **JSON array of student objects**.

---

## 🧼 Step 6: Code Clean-Up (Next Step Preview)

Right now, we’re **hardcoding data inside the controller**, which is fine for learning but:

❌ Makes the controller **bulky**
❌ **Violates** separation of concerns
❌ Not **scalable** for real projects

---

### ✅ Recommended Next Step:

We’ll move the data logic into a **separate static repository class** in the next part. This will:

* Follow **Clean Architecture**
* Make the controller lean and focused
* Separate **data responsibilities**

---

### 🧩 Word-by-Word Explanation:

| Word          | What It Means                 | Simple Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `public`      | **Access modifier**           | This method is **visible to other parts of the application**, such as the Web API framework or other classes. It must be `public` for the API to allow external clients (like Postman or Swagger) to call it.      |
| `IEnumerable` | **Interface for collections** | This means the method returns a **sequence or list** of data. `IEnumerable<T>` allows you to **iterate over** the items using a `foreach` loop. It's more general than `List<T>`, and better for read-only access. |
| `<Student>`   | **Generic type parameter**    | This tells the compiler that we are working with a **collection of `Student` objects** (not just any type). So the return value will be like: `[Student1, Student2, ...]`.                                         |
| `GetStudents` | **Method name**               | This is the name of the function. By convention in C#, method names use **PascalCase** and `Get` implies we are **fetching** something — here, a list of students.                                                 |
| `()`          | **Parameter list**            | These parentheses indicate that the method **takes no input parameters**. If we wanted to filter by ID or name, we’d put parameters inside here.                                                                   |

---

### 💡 Real-World Analogy:

Think of this method like a **school receptionist**.

* You call the receptionist (`public`) — they are available to the public.
* You ask: “Give me the list of students” → they **return a list** (`IEnumerable<Student>`).
* The method name is `GetStudents` — just like asking “Can you *get* me the students?”
* No inputs (`()`) means you didn’t give any filter like "only 10th grade".

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Why `IEnumerable<Student>` instead of `List<Student>`?

Both will work, but `IEnumerable` is preferred when:

* You just **want to loop** through the data.
* You don’t need advanced operations like `Add`, `Remove`, etc.
* It allows the method to return **any collection type**, making it more flexible and **loosely coupled**.
