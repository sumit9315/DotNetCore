# 📘 VBA Tutorials – Part 4: **Why Web API?**

**Instructor:** Venkat
**Topic:** Why should we use Web API in modern applications?

---

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to **VBA Tutorials** – Part 4.
I am **Venkat**, and in this session, we’ll discuss:

> 🔍 **Why do we need to go for Web API?**

In the previous video, we saw **what a Web API is**.
Now, let’s explore **why** it is **beneficial**.

---

## 🏗️ Traditional Application Structure

In traditional architecture:

* We **build all three components** as a **single application**:

  1. **Database Layer**
  2. **Business Logic Layer**
  3. **UI Layer**

When using this structure, the final application:

* Produces **HTML** as output
* Is rendered directly in the **web browser**

### Example:

If we build a **classic Amazon website**, all three layers are bundled into **one application**.

* When a user opens `amazon.com`, the **HTML is rendered** in their browser.
* This works fine for **web applications** only.

---

## 📱 Challenge: What About Mobile Apps?

Suppose now we want to build an **Amazon mobile app**.

### Problem:

* The previous traditional approach **bundled** all layers together.
* We **cannot reuse** the business logic and database logic independently.

So, we are forced to:

* Build **UI for mobile**
* Rebuild the **business logic layer**
* Reconnect the **database layer**

This means we must **reimplement** the core logic again — a huge waste of **time** and **effort**.

---

## 📺 Adding More Frontends? More Problems

Let’s say we want to build:

* **Amazon Prime** for desktop
* **Amazon Prime** mobile app

Each new application would again require:

* Separate **UI**
* Separate **business logic**
* Separate **data layer**

This is clearly **inefficient** and **not reusable**.

---

## 💡 Solution: Middleware Approach Using Web API

### Modern Architecture

Instead of duplicating logic, we create:

1. **Web API** as a **Middleware**
2. Individual **UI applications** for:

   * Desktop website
   * Mobile app
   * Amazon Prime (desktop & mobile)

### Centralized Flow:

```
[ Database ] 
     ↓
[ Web API (Middleware) ]
     ↓
[ Any Number of UI Applications ]
```

---

## 🔁 Benefits of Middleware Architecture

Each frontend UI (desktop, mobile, etc.) can now:

* Call the **Web API**
* Web API will:

  * Fetch data from the **database**
  * Apply **business rules**
  * Return **processed data**

## 🧠 Reusability Example

| Application Type         | Uses Same Web API? |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Amazon Website (Desktop) | ✅ Yes              |
| Amazon Mobile App        | ✅ Yes              |
| Amazon Prime Desktop App | ✅ Yes              |
| Amazon Prime Mobile App  | ✅ Yes              |

No need to **duplicate** business logic or data access code — it's all handled by **Web API**.

---

## 🎯 Why Choose Web API?

| Traditional App (All-in-One)   | Web API + Separate UI              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Code repeated across platforms | Code reused via centralized API    |
| Business logic tied to UI      | Business logic separated in API    |
| Difficult to maintain & scale  | Easy to scale and update           |
| Cannot reuse for mobile apps   | Reusable for desktop, mobile, etc. |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

> **Web API enables reusability.**
> You write the backend logic once and **consume it from anywhere** – desktop, mobile, tablet, or even other services.

With traditional apps, you must rewrite the same logic for every new frontend.
But with **Web API**, you build once and reuse forever.
