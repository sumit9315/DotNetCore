# üìò VVPA Tutorials ‚Äì Part 2: Building and Consuming Web API

**Welcome to VVPA Tutorials ‚Äì Part 2**
In the previous session, we discussed **how Web API got introduced in the market**.

In this video, we will discuss:

* ‚úÖ How to **build a Web API**
* ‚úÖ How it is **consumed by other platforms or applications**

---

## üß© Recap: SOAP-Based Applications

Previously, we discussed **SOAP applications**.

### Key Concepts:

* SOAP services come with a **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)** or **proxy**.
* These are essentially **instruction files**.
* Using these instructions, we can:

  * **Serialize/Deserialize** .NET objects into **XML** format.

```text
.NET Object ‚Üí Serialize ‚Üí XML ‚Üí Sent to Java/Angular/Python ‚Üí Deserialize ‚Üí Native Object
```

Other platforms like **Java, Angular, React, Python** consume the data using the same WSDL instructions.

## üåê Enter Web API with REST Implementation

Now, let‚Äôs talk about **Web API services**, which are built using **REST**.

### What is REST?

> **REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**

It means:

* Whatever **data we have**, we **send it as-is** to the service.
* No need to **serialize or deserialize** it manually.
* No intermediate steps like converting into XML using WSDL or proxies.

---

## üì§ Sending Data in Web API

### Scenario:

* Suppose we have **XML data**.
* With REST, we can **directly send this XML** to:

  * Java
  * Angular
  * Python
  * React applications

‚úÖ **No WSDL required**
‚úÖ **No proxy classes needed**

## üîÑ Moving from XML to JSON

In place of XML, we now use **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

### Why JSON over XML?

| Feature     | XML                               | JSON                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Structure   | Uses **opening and closing tags** | Uses simple **key-value pairs** |
| Size        | Verbose                           | Lightweight                     |
| Readability | Verbose for small data            | Cleaner and shorter             |
| Popularity  | Declining                         | Widely adopted                  |

#### üìå Example:

**XML:**

```xml
<firstName>Venkat</firstName>
```

**JSON:**

```json
"firstName": "Venkat"
```

As shown above:

* In **XML**, you must specify both opening and closing tags.
* In **JSON**, you only specify the parameter name once.
* This makes **JSON more memory-efficient** and simpler.

## ‚úÖ REST with JSON ‚Äì The Preferred Approach

Today, most applications work with **JSON** instead of XML.

### Advantages of REST + JSON:

* No need for **WSDL**
* No need for **proxy generation**
* Simple and fast **data transmission**
* Easily consumable by modern platforms (JavaScript, Python, mobile apps, etc.)

### Flow:

```text
Client sends JSON ‚Üí Web API receives JSON ‚Üí Processes it ‚Üí Responds back with JSON
```

This is how **Web API services are built and consumed** in modern application ecosystems.

---

## üôè Conclusion

* Web API uses **REST architecture** to simplify data exchange.
* **JSON** is now preferred over XML due to its **lightweight nature**.
* No WSDL or proxy is needed anymore ‚Äî services can **communicate directly**.
